# MNIST AI

This is the development of an AI that works with the MNIST database for recognizing handwritten numbers.

## **Disclaimer**

This is my first attempt(s) at developing an AI, so it is almost guaranteed to be a work in progress. I appreciate your understanding as I learn and improve.

When I initially ran the AI on some random weights and biases, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the first test case worked decently! After testing it on the rest of the smaller sub-test set, that quickly disappeared, as it should have, thus restoring balance to the universe.
